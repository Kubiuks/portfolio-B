## Final Release

###### Previous Plan

Originally, our plan for Final Release was to start development of Information Extraction module, which would further analyse texts extracted from photos.

###### Alternative Plan

Due to the situation and different work, family and health related issues of all members, our time and focus has been greatly decreased. This made us come to a conclusion that we do not have enough time to implement a fully working information extraction solution. Instead, we decided to build up on what we have and refine different aspects of the projects, like login, privileges and storage.

## Working remotely

We had to accept the fact that digital communication was our only way of further collaborating on the project, which proved to be massively less productive than a live working sessions. Additionally, our team member Jingxuan Liu has left the country to return home to China, which made collaborating even harder. In this time we mostly contacted each other via messenger or short messenger calls.
